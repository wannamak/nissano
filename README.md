nissano will remotely activate your Nissan vehicle's HVAC (cooling or heating).
It does not require sensitive permissions like Nissan's official app (eg, location).

Log in with your NissanConnect credentials and vehicle's VIN.

Install the app directly from the <a href=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nissan>Google Play Store</a>.
